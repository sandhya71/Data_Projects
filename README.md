# DATA_EXPLORATION- PROJECT1

Before performing more complex analyses or modeling, 
data exploration is an essential step in the data analysis process that involves looking at and comprehending a dataset. Gaining insights into the data, spotting patterns, oddities, 
and links, and coming to wise conclusions about how to proceed with data analysis are the main objectives of data exploration. Following are some crucial elements of data exploration:

Data cleaning: It's crucial to clean the data before exploring it. This calls for handling outliers, handling missing numbers, and guaranteeing data consistency.
